"""Guard that the Python 3.9 syntax gate can fail.

``python39-compat.yml`` runs one ruff rule over every hooks directory to
catch ``X | Y`` annotations that raise ``TypeError`` at import time on
system Python 3.9. It selected UP007, which never fires on that input:
UP007 rewrites ``Optional[X]`` into ``X | Y``, the opposite direction, so
``def f(x: int | None)`` exited 0 and the gate reported green on exactly
the code it was written to stop. FA102 is the rule that flags a PEP 604
union in a module targeting py39 without ``from __future__ import
annotations``.

The probe test runs ruff on a file carrying the defect, so a rule swap
that reintroduces a gate unable to fail turns this red.
