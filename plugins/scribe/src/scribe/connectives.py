"""Measure how often a document explains itself with ", so".

``tier5.so_connective`` marks each consequence tail ("the index was
stale, so the lookup missed"). One is ordinary English. What reads as
generated is the habit: every fact followed by its consequence, joined
with a comma. That is a rate over the page, the same kind of reading as
``scribe.negation.check_negation_density``, and it is advisory for the
same reason. The regex is read from ``en.yaml`` and the two checks
therefore cannot drift apart.
