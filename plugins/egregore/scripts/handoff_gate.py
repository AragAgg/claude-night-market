"""The night-shift handoff gate: the rule that no valid handoff, no run.

A work item may only execute unattended when four documents exist and
agree with each other. This module is the only place that judgment is
made, and it makes it without a model, because a rule a model can be
talked out of at 3am is not a rule.

``night_run.main`` calls ``check_item`` before it walks anything and
reads the admitted documents back through ``load_item``, so the rule
above is the rule that guards a run.

The gate refuses more often than a person would. That is deliberate. A
refusal costs a one-line edit the evening before; a bad pass costs the
night.

Exit codes double as the state, worst news first:

===== ==============  ============================================
Code  State           Meaning
===== ==============  ============================================
0     ``READY``       every check passed
1     ``MISSING``     a required document is absent
2     ``MALFORMED``   frontmatter unparseable, or a required key,
                      document key type or schema version is wrong
3     ``UNSAFE``      the item asks for something no item may have
4     ``INCOHERENT``  the four documents contradict each other
