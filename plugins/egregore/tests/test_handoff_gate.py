"""Tests for the handoff gate.

The gate is the harness's one hard rule: no valid handoff, no run. Every
test below pins one way an item can be refused, because a gate that
passes something it should have caught costs a whole night.

The mutation tests matter most. Each takes a known-good item, breaks one
field, and asserts the gate goes red. If removing a check does not turn
one of these red, that check was not load-bearing.
