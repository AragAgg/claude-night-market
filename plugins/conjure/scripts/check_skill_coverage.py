"""Cross-check the skills plugin.json registers against the ones on disk.

Both directions are checked, and both come from plugin.json and the
directory rather than a hardcoded list, so a newly added skill is
covered without editing this script. A registered skill with no
SKILL.md does not load. A skill on disk that plugin.json omits is
invisible to the harness however complete it is, which is the likelier
mistake when a plugin gains a provider.
